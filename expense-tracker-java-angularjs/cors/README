This project contains a CORS servlet filter that was copied with modifications from Tomcat 7.0.42.
The filter is useful in contexts other than Tomcat and repackaging it here allows it to be used without
requiring Tomcat dependencies.

The NOTICE and LICENSE files required by the Apache 2 license are included with the project.
