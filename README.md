# My code portfolio

This repository serves two purposes:

1. For potential employers, it is my code portfolio. If you are thinking about hiring me - first, thank you, I'm sure you are very kind. But, more to the point, you can come here for evidence that I know the technologies I claim to know and to judge whether you will like the code I write for you.
2. For myself, it is intended to be a storehouse of application prototypes. When I am starting a project to build a Java-based RESTful web service, for instance, I can come here for an example of how I have done that in the past. When I am learning a new technology, the end result of my studies should be a new example implementation in the portfolio.

The code here is not terribly interesting but I have tried, at least, to keep it clean. The original idea was that it would be implementations and re-implementations of a simple application that allows a user to track his/her expenses. I built the first version of this app for a job interview and the project seemed to be a good size and shape for demonstrating the essentials of an application written on platform X in language Y with framework Z. Unfortunately, this first version is still the only version. But probably you did not want to read and I did not want to write 15 implementations of a simple expense tracker app, so perhaps it is for the best.

Final note: I am primarily a back-end developer. I am definitely not a designer. I promise that my code is prettier than my UIs.
