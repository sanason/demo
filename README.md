# My code portfolio

This repository serves two purposes:

1. For potential employers, it is my code portfolio. If you are thinking about hiring me, you can come here for evidence that I know the technologies I claim to know and to judge whether you will like the code I write for you.
2. For me, it is a storehouse of application prototypes. When I am starting a project to build a Java-based RESTful web service, for instance, I can come here for an example of how I have done that in the past. When I am learning a new technology, the end result of my studies should be a new example implementation in the portfolio.

This repository is not intended to be interesting or useful outside its two stated purposes. It is not intended to be forked. I hope someday to work on interesting and useful projects that can be open-sourced. Those projects will live in other, probably messier, repositories.

This repository is all implementations and re-implementations of a simple application that allows a user to track his/her expenses. Obviously, it is a toy project. The original version was built for a job interview and the project seemed to be a good size and shape for demonstrating the essentials of an application written on platform X in language Y with framework Z.
